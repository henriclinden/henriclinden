Hi. I'm Henric and this is my space.

I am a retired software engineer who has been working with embedded, wireless development for many years.
The latter devoted more to sales and business development than hacking, but I have never stopped tinkering with hardware and trying new things.
Maybe my Github page can help you, but probably not.

Anyway; keep hacking!
